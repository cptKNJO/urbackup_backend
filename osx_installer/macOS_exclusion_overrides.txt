# macos_exclusion_overrides.txt
#
# This file determines which of the standard macOS backup exclusions, as defined
# in Urbackup, are overridden - so as to force their inclusion in backups.
#
# This should not normally be required - and indeed, forcing the backup of some items
# may produce errors in the backup if the system does not allow access to them.
#
# The specific exclusion required to be overridden can be found in the Urbackup Client
# logfile - /Library/Logs/urbackup_client_backend.log
# Any item which is excluded due to a standard backup exclusion is noted against the
# exclusion term which prevents its backup.
#
# So, for example, to override the exclusion of the .Trash folder inside each user
# account, uncomment the following entry:
#
# /Users/:/.Trash
#
# Override entries should be exactly as quoted in the Urbackup Client logfile, and
# should be entered one-per-line without a preceding #
